ðŸ–¼ iOS image gallery app built with **UIKit**.   

---

## Project Overview

GalleryApp is an image gallery application that loads pictures from the **Unsplash API**, provides a detail view, and allows users to manage their favorite photos.  
The app is built with **MVVM** and clear separation of layers (**Domain / Data / Presentation**).  
It uses **Alamofire** for networking, **Kingfisher** for image caching and smooth transitions, and **RealmSwift** for local persistence.
